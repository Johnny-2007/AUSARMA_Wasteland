 And Vibas serverside killmessage script.

 Edited by KiloSwiss
 All errors in this script are produced by me, don't blame anyone else for this! =)

 Known issues:
 Kills with Mines, Satchelcharges, etc. will display the players actual weapon he's holding in his hand(s) and not the mine/satchel.
 Killing respawning players will only announce the killers name, same for kills over a distance of 3000 meters (might be an issue with mines).
 This will also show incredible long sniper kills with almost impossible weapons if someone is killed with a mine and distance is between 1500 and 3000m
