 And Vibas serverside killmessage script.

 Edited by KiloSwiss
 All errors in this script are produced by me, don't blame anyone else for this!

 Known issues:
 Kills with Mines, Satchelcharges, etc. will display the players actual weapon he's holding in his hand(s) and not the mine/satchel.
 Killing respawning players will only announce the killers name, same for kills over a distance of 5000 meters (might be an issue with mines).
